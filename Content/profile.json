    "Title": "Parking Portal",
    "Desc": "Parking Portal is an application that hopes to provide easy and convenient parking for SPU students. With an app on their phones, students can make an account using their SPU emails and buy parking passes. These passes will allow them to park at any SPU parking lot they want. To better support the user's needs, we allow them to either buy a pass by the hour or buy a pass for the whole day. By allowing students to save their car's license plate and their credit card information they will be able to purchase these passes in a matter of seconds. And on the unfortunate chance they are issued a ticket, our users can pay for it directly on the app. This application has a System Proposal and System Specification completed, which can both be found in Git Hub. The System Proposal gives a complete breakdown of what the application will entail, including any requirements that need to be met in order to build it. The System Specification also gives an overview of the application software layout and includes UI designs for the app.",
